# mindliner

Enterprise knowledge management application. The building blocks are knowlets, i.e. small quasi-atomic
pieces of information. There can then be freely associated with one another.

While this sounds trivial, Mindliner had to solve the **confidentiality dilemma**. On the one hand we want all information to be wired-up exactly like in our brain irrespective of project or people boundaries. On the other hand, we want to only share bit with others.
