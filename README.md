# mindliner

## intro

Mindliner is an enterprise knowledge management application focusing on text. The building blocks are knowlets, i.e. small quasi-atomic pieces of text. These can be freely associated with one another.

While this sounds trivial, Mindliner had to solve the dilemma between wanting to share and needing to keep confidential.

## building

Mindliner has been built using the Ant builder in NetBeans.
