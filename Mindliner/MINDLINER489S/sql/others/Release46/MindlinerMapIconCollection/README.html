        <p>As of this release, Mindlner offers icons in maps. However, the icon management
        components are still missing. Instead this collection must be manually uploaded
        to each of the data pools using the Admin tool.</p>
        <p>On the Admin tool in the Testing pane, the administrator can specify
        a template object (must belong to selected client) from which the default
        attributes will be copied to the icon objects. After the template object
        is defined choose button Add icons for client</p>
